'Resources' directory for the Wonderland project
===========================================

This is the directory in which game specific resources such as bitmaps, fonts
and other kept.

Please note that, contrary to the platforms on which Wonderland is intended to
run, the engine itself has no support for internationalization. All the strings
in the engine are held as ASCII strings. This is a design choice and as of now
there are no plans to include it but someday it may change.
