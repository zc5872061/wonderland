'Code' directory for the Wonderland project
===========================================

In this directory all the C/C++/Objective-C code belonging to the project resides.

As of now it include both the generic engine code (i.e. renderer, varius resource managers, platform
interfaces etc.) and the game code (as of now BadBalls2 - a 3D version of a simple logic game released for bada).

In the future, once Lua is successuly integrated into the engine, game-specific code will be written in Lua and 
put to a different directory (named 'Scripts' or something like that)



'Platforms' directory
==========================================

The 'Platforms' directory holds platform-specific code which is require to 
run the Wonderland code. Inside this 'Platforms' directory there are 
subdirectories, each for each platform.
